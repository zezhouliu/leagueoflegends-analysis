\begin{abstract}
The online electronic sports (eSports) community has grown significantly 
over the past decade, with over 1.7B people who play video games by 2014 
and 2B by 2015. 
Gamers spend more than 3 billion hours per week playing 
video games, generating over 400 Terabytes of data per week.  
This number is expected to increase dramatically as the growth 
rate of the eSports community continue to rise.  The potential applications 
for this deluge of data can be drawn from the parallels to traditional sports.

Data analysis has been used in the traditional sports settings to predict 
useful statistics about sports games even before the games occur.  
Machine learning models benefit from the large amounts of data available 
in past sports games and data anlysists can use a variety of tools to 
predict the winning team, the end-game score, and even 
individual player performances of future games.  

Machine learning is a natural application for the emerging eSports field 
given the large amounts of data available and the promise to mimic the 
traditional sports setting.  We show that by applying several machine learning 
techniques on the data available for League of Legends, we can accurately 
extract meaningful statistics such as win-rates.
