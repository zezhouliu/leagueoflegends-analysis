\section{Conclusion}
Our machine learning model evolved continuously as the project developed.  Each model gave us further insights into the next steps, eventually leading to a model that attempts to incorporate as much information as available in the data.  The results looks very promising in the current stage, with over 90\% accuracy in predicting match outcomes. However, the computation remains very expensive.  Aggregating the data to train on a single match requires collecting 1500 matches the ten players' recent histories. Future work will be done on trying to optimize this further so that possibly this may be deployable as a service. Acquiring a production key with a much higher rate-limit will also allow for faster data collection. The high-levels of accuracy may be due to overfitting since we have a relatively small sample set. The likelihood of overfitting should shrink as we continue to collect larger data sets.
